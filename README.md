# Engineering at Emmersion
At Emmersion, we strive to create an effective software development culture built on sustainable principles.
Some of the practices we value are:

* Lean product development
* Cross-functional teams
* Mob programming
* Test-driven development
* Continuous delivery
* DevOps


## Open Source

Sometimes we miss our useful and well-known work libraries when working on personal projects.
So in order to ease that pain for our engineers, and to contribute back to the community at large, we have open sourced some of our internal tooling.

These are "open source" in the literal sense that the source code is made public (generally via the [MIT License](./LICENSE)) more than the open source development model.
Since they are libraries which we use in our production environment, we plan to develop them internally, following our own (admittedly opinionated) ways of doing things while avoiding complexity, flexibility, and features which we don't use.

This means that while we appreciate suggestions, bug fixes, and pull requests, we may not accept them even if they are good ideas.
We will strive to follow up on issues and PRs in as best we can, but we do not have a team dedicated to this work.

We hope that our employees and others will find this useful.
